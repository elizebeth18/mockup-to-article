	This assignment work has really been exicting.Actually I loved what I did, it was really cool stuff !!!!.When it comes to the new things I learnt I can say that
I came across HTML tags like strike through and horizontal rule which were new to me, and I have never used before.While I was doing this assignment the mozilla's reference
document was really helpful and it even helped me to understand the difference between <em> tag and <i> tag. In this assignment I didnt find any diffculty because things were
pretty straight forward and not only that tutorial and mozilla's reference document were really helpful and , last but not the least even the hints too.
